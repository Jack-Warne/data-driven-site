Hi Rob,
This is a data driven site that uses typescript amd is then compiled using watch in the terminal to js and then run through the website. 
It uses two api's one to fetch the area from the postcode and another to get the weather from the retrieved postcode.
Hopefully this is a decent enough showcase look forward to hearing from you!
